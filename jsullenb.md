Git fork and git clone both make copies of the repository.  Fork leaves that copy on your GitHub account, while clone puts the copy on your computer.  
Both give you read and write permissions to the copied repository.  Both also allow you to make changes to the original repository if you have permission to, but
in different ways.  If you fork, you can make the changes and push the recommended changes to the original repository, and the repository owner can decide whether or not
to enact these changes.  In contrast, you can push cloned repositories to the original directly as long as you have write access to the original directory.  Git branch
makes a copy of code from the main branch that remains in the original repository that can be written without editing the original code, and pushed to the main code as long
as you have write permissions for the repository.
