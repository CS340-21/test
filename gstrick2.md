A github fork creates a copy of a repository. It creates a link between the original repository and your personal one. A git clone is a command line tool that copies the repository to your machine. The difference between a clone and fork is that with a fork, the repository remains on the website for github (in your account) while the clone command copies it directly to your machine. A git branch is a new line of development within a project. It can be thought of as a new directory or work space. It also serves as a timeline to see when changes were made. It is different from a git clone and repo in the sense that it is not the entire project, it could be a sub section of it or a new addition.
