Forking on github simply creates a copy of a repository under the new users github account for them to use without altering the original repository. Git clone copies a github repository onto a local machine for use. Git branch copies only a certain portion of a repository's data, so that one portion/aspect can be developed without impacting the original repository (they can be merged later if needed).
