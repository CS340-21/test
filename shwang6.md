A git clone copies an existing repository onto your local machine.
A git fork is done through your GitHub account - it creates a personal copy of the original repository and it remains on your GitHub account. 
A git branch is a set of commits contained inside of a repository. Branches allow you to develop/code a new modification without affecting the main part of a project.
