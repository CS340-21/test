Explain the differences among github fork, git clone, and git branch:

When you fork a repository, a copy of the original repository is created, but the repository
remains on your GitHub account. Also, the forked repository is independent from the original
repository. With git clone, the repository is simply copied onto your local machine. Git branch
is similar to fork except for the fact that it is not independent from the original repository.
