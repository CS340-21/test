A GitHub fork is basically a copy of a repository. A git clone copies a repository version control system to a local drive.There you can make changes locally,
and then push them to the repository. A git branch is a history of changes and there may be many other branches with different changes. Any branch made apart
from the main branch in the repository allow users to make changes to the repository without affecting the main branch.
