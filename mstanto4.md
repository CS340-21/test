Github Fork:
Forking allows for multiple people to work on the same repositiory in different ways. A pull request must be made in order to merge changes. Forking also allows for changes without messing with the main branch. Any changes pushed to the fork must go through a pull request to be added to the main repository.

Github Clone:
Cloning copies the entire main repository that allows editing. Users must then push and pull changes. Cloning copies the repository to your local machine. 

Github Branch:
Branching allows you to work on different features of a project seperate from the main line of development. It does not copy the entire source tree.
