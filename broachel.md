A fork is a copy of a repository to your GitHub account that acts as a bridge between your copy and the original project, which you can contriubute to using a pull request.
Or this fork may become its own project entirely.
A clone is a copy onto your local machine, which is quicker but usually only used to access your fork of a project.
A branch is a part of the original repository where you are able to make edits without affecting the main part (branch) of the project. A branch is usually a temporary workspace.
