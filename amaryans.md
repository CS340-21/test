A fork is just essentially taking the whole GitHub project/repo and adding it to your GitHub account. This is different from a branch which will take a repo and branch it into you rown workspace, lots of times used when each person needs to add a feature and do not want to directly use the main branch which can cause problems. This allows for people to merge the code easier. A clone is simply taking a repo and adding it to a local machine.
