Explain the differences among github fork, git clone, and git branch.

Forking, cloning, and branches in github are similar in that they all revolve around the idea of creating a copy of a repository to allow the individuals to modify without affecting the
original repository.

Cloning allows an individual to create a copy of a repository to their local machine.  
Forking is similar as it still creates a copy of a repository, but under their username rather than their local machine.
A branch can be thought of as a copy of sections (from the original repository) to allow users to work on different sections at a time.
