**Github Fork:** a copy of a repo that is made in the user's account. It gives the user full permission to write to their own personal copy of the repo. It also allows the user to make changes and create pull requests/issues in the original repo so that their changes can be approved and merged to it.

**Github Clone:** a copy of a repo on the user's local machine. It allows the user to make changes in the repo. The commits can be merged to the original repo, as long as the user has the correct permissions.

**Github Branch:** a new head for all of the user's future commits. It allows the user to make any changes they want to the repo without having an effect on the master branch/original head. If they want to add their changes to the master branch, they will have to open a pull request and get approval to merge. Branches are typically used when users want to add multiple features to applications.
