Git fork copies a repo into the user's account. It gives the user full access to modify their copy of the repo. Once the changes are made, the user can make a pull request in the original repo and once the pull request is approved, the repo is merged. Git clone copies a repo onto the user's local machine and the user commits changes which are merged onto the repo. Git branch create a new branch, which allows the user to make changes and commit those changes without effecting the master branch. To merge changes from the user branch to master branch, the user has to create a pull request, which upon approval merges the user branch to the master branch.
