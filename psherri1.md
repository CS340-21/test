<Github Fork>
This means to fork a copy of the original repo to your own github repository. You can use this fork to experiment on the original repo without directly affecting it. Also, you can add code back to the original repo by creating a pull request and merging your code with the original.

<Github Clone> 
Clone is very similar to fork but you are cloning the repository to your local machine rather than your github repository. This repository can also be merged to the orignal by creating a pull request.

<Github Branch> 
Branches allow you rto directly work on a section of code without affecting the master or main code. This is especially useful with multiple people working on the same project. Each member can work separately on different features without directly affecting the main code. Once the feature is ready to be implemented, the user can submit a pull request and merge the branch to the master code.
