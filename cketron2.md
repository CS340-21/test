### [GitHub Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
A fork is a copy of someone else's repository placed in your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to your copy without affecting the original project. Forks are commonly used to propose changes to another proect or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own. It is also possible to keep your fork of a repository synced with the upstream repository via the commands `git remote add upstream {url to upstream repo}` to add the upstream repo and `git merge upstream/{branch to sync}` to sync your local branch with the upstream branch.

### [Git Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
A local copy (_on your machine_) of a remote repository that allows you to sync between the local and the remote repositories using git commands (_fetch, pull, add, commit, push, etc._) Cloning to your local computer makes it easier to fix merge conflicts, add/remove files, and push larger commits. 

### [Git Branch](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
Branches allow you make modifications, develop features, and safely experiment within a **contained area of your repository**. GitHub names the default branch the main branch. New branches can be created from any existing branch, including the main branch, and you can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.
