A fork is a personaly copy of someone's repository which you can edit yourself, and submit pull requests to contribute your work to their project. A clone is a local copy of your repository, whether it is a fork or your original. A branch is a copy of the repository that enables you to edit directly in the repository without affecting the edits others are making in the default branch. This is different from a fork, since this requires permission to create within the repository, whereas a fork could be made without permission.
