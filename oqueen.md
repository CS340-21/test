# GitHub Terminology

GitHub fork: Forking creates a linked copy of a repository that is stored on your own account. This allows you to modify code in the respository without those modifications showing up in the main repository. The main difference in forking is that you don't need explicit access from the repository's owner.

GitHub clone: Cloning creates a local copy of a repository to your machine. This allows you to directly edit the repository from your local machine, making commits and pushes (if you have those permissions). A cloned repository is where you do all of your work, contributing to the main code repository.

GitHub branch: Branching is a way of diverging from the main line of development in a project. It is similar to cloning, but in a branch, you can diverge from the main line of development without changing the contents in this main line. Branching and merging is a more lightweight process than in forking.
