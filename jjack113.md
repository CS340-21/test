A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting 
the original project.

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default 
branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request. Branches allow 
you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy 
on your computer and sync between the two locations.
