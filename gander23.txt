A fork replicates the files in the main repo from github and places them within the repo of your choice.

Cloning on the other hand, replicates the files from the main repo and places them on your local computer.

Branches serve as a snapshot of your changes, allowing you to revert to a previous set of changes or to make changes without affecting the master code.
