A GitHub fork is a copy of a repository that includes the repository's branches and history.

`git clone` copies a repository from a service like GitHub or GitLab to a local drive. Changes can be made on the drive, and then pushed to the original repository.

`git branch` returns the current branch of the repository. A branch of a git repository is a history of changes that are independent of other branches. Every repository has a main or master branch, and users make other branches as to make changes to the repository without affecting the main branch. Additionally, branches also function as a place to stabilize features, which are then merged back into the main branch.
