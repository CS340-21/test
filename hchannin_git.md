Explain the differences among github fork, git clone, and git branch

Github Fork:
Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes without changing the original project. They are often used to suggest changes to other people's project or use someone else's ideas as a starting point. You can propose changes by forking the folder, making changes, and then submitting a pull request.

Github Clone:
When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Cloning a repository allows you to more easily push larger commits as well as operate on the repo from your local machine.

Github Branch:
Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request. This way, you can edit just parts of a whole repository without making changes to its base. You can then submit a pull request to just edit the branch or merge the branch into its base branches.

The difference between the 3:
Fork and clone both make copies of a repository, but Clone makes a copy of a repository to your local computer, while Fork just makes a copy to your GitHub account. Branches are different in that they are an addendum to the original repository, in which you can edit just parts of the repository without editing the whole thing (like when just using clone or fork). All of these can be used in tandem to effectively create edits to code.
